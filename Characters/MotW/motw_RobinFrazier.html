      <ul>Moves:</ul>
      <ul>Deal with the Agency: When you deal with the Agency, requesting help or gear, or making excuses for a failure, roll +Sharp. On a 10+, you’re good—your request for gear or personnel is okayed, or your slip-up goes unnoticed. On a 7-9, things aren’t so great. You might get chewed out by your superiors and there’ll be fallout, but you get what you need for the job. On a miss, you screwed up: you might be suspended or under investigation, or just in the doghouse. You certainly aren’t going to get any help until you sort it all out.</ul>
      <ul>Bottle It Up: If you want, you can take up to +3 bonus when you act under pressure. For each +1 you use, the Keeper holds 1. That hold can be spentlater—one for one—to give you -1 on any move except act under pressure.</ul>
      <ul>Battlefield Awareness: You always know what’s happening around you, and what to watch out for. Take +1 armour (max 2-armour) on top of whatever you get from your gear.</ul>
      <ul>Leave No One Behind: In combat, when you help someone escape, roll +Sharp. On a 10+ you get them out clean. On a 7-9, you can either get them out or suffer no harm, you choose. On a miss, you fail to get them out and you’ve attracted hostile attention.</ul>
