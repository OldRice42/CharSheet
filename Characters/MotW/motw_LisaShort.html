      <ul>Moves:</ul>
      <ul>Hex: When you cast a spell (with use magic), as well as the normal effects, you may pick from the following:</ul>
      <blockquote>
        <ul>• The target contracts a disease.</ul>
        <ul>• The target immediately suffers harm (2-harm magic ignore-armour).</ul>
        <ul>• The target breaks something precious or important.</ul>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>Jinx: You can encourage coincidences to occur, the way you want. When you jinx a target, roll +Weird. On a 10+ hold 2 and on a 7-9 hold 1. On a miss, the Keeper holds 2 over you to be used in the same way. Spend your hold to:</ul>
      <blockquote>
        <ul>• Interfere with a hunter, giving them -1 forward.</ul>
        <ul>• Help a hunter, giving them +1 forward, by interfering with their enemy.</ul>
        <ul>• Interfere with what a monster, minion, or bystander is trying to do.</ul>
        <ul>• Inflict 1-harm on the target due to an accident.</ul>
        <ul>• The target finds something you left for them.</ul>
          <ul>• The target loses something that you will soon find.</ul>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>The Sight: You can see the invisible, especially spirits and magical influences. You may communicate with (maybe even make deals with) the spirits you see, and they give you more opportunities to spot clues when you investigate a mystery.</ul>
      <ul>The Big Whammy: You can use your powers to kick some ass: roll +Weird instead of +Tough. The attack has 2-harm close obvious ignore-armour. On a miss, you’ll get a magical backlash.</ul>
      <ul>Mystical Library: If you use your library’s occult tomes and grimoires, preparing with your tomes and grimoires, take +1 forward for use magic.</ul>
      <ul>This Might Sting: You can use magic to heal 3-harm, but the process is exceptionally painful. On a 7-9 it also leaves a gnarly scar.</ul>
      <ul>Unnatural Appeal: Roll +Weird instead of +Charm when you  anipulate someone.</ul>
